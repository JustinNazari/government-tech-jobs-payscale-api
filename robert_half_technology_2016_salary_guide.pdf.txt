Introduction





Competition among businesses for top IT talent today makes it critical
for managers to rethink their recruitment and retention methods.
Speeding up hiring times, training from within, filling skills gaps with

project professionals and offering attractive compensation can help
you hire – and keep – the best and brightest for your organization.

In particular, the salaries you offer must be kept at least on par with those of
other firms in your industry and geographic region. But to do that, you have

to stay continually up to date on what your competitors are offering. To help
you benchmark your compensation levels, Robert Half Technology releases
a Salary Guideevery year, complete with the most current information and
advice on starting compensation, workplace issues and the hiring outlook.

We are pleased to present the 2016 Salary Guid,ewhich forecasts
compensation trends across a wide array of technology positions. Salaries
reflect starting pay only and do not include bonuses and other forms of

compensation. The salary information in the guide is based on the real-
life observations of our Robert Half Technology staffing and recruiting
professionals who make thousands of interim and full-time placements each
year, as well as our frequent surveys of chief information officers (CIOs) and
other IT professionals.

As you grow and build your workforce this year, we hope you’ll find the
information in this guide useful.

   8 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITING
   AND RETAINING IT TALENT

   One of the best ways to approach the shortage of highly
   skilled talent is to build a reputation as an employer of choice.
   Here are eight strategies for achieving that status:



   1. Pay at or above market salaries for top talent.

   2. Provide exciting and challenging assignments.

   3. Foster a corporate culture where innovation rules, and
      business and technology are intertwined.

   4. Make sure tech pros have the latest tools.

   5. Promote flexible schedules and remote working
      arrangements.

   6. Offer professional development opportunities.

   7. Show a clear path for growth and promotion.

   8. Listen to employees and take action on their requests,
      as appropriate.



   Another strategy for success: Establish a strong employee referral
   program. Referrals can be the key to connecting with in-demand
   talent before the competition even knows these professionals are
   in the market.
